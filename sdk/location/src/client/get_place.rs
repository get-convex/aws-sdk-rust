    /// Constructs a fluent builder for the [`GetPlace`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder) operation.
    ///
    /// - The fluent builder is configurable:
    ///   - [`index_name(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder::index_name) / [`set_index_name(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder::set_index_name):<br>required: **true**<br><p>The name of the place index resource that you want to use for the search.</p><br>
    ///   - [`place_id(impl Into<String>)`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder::place_id) / [`set_place_id(Option<String>)`](crate::operation::get_place::builders::GetPlaceFluentBuilder::set_place_id):<br>required: **true**<br><p>The identifier of the place to find.</p> <p>While you can use PlaceID in subsequent requests, PlaceID is not intended to be a permanent identifier and the ID can change between consecutive API calls. Please see the following PlaceID behaviour for each data provider:</p> <ul>  <li>   <p>Esri: Place IDs will change every quarter at a minimum. The typical time period for these changes would be March, June, September, and December. Place IDs might also change between the typical quarterly change but that will be much less frequent.</p></li>  <li>   <p>HERE: We recommend that you cache data for no longer than a week to keep your data data fresh. You can assume that less than 1% ID shifts will release over release which is approximately 1 - 2 times per week.</p></li>  <li>   <p>Grab: Place IDs can expire or become invalid in the following situations.</p>   <ul>    <li>     <p>Data operations: The POI may be removed from Grab POI database by Grab Map Ops based on the ground-truth, such as being closed in the real world, being detected as a duplicate POI, or having incorrect information. Grab will synchronize data to the Waypoint environment on weekly basis.</p></li>    <li>     <p>Interpolated POI: Interpolated POI is a temporary POI generated in real time when serving a request, and it will be marked as derived in the <code>place.result_type</code> field in the response. The information of interpolated POIs will be retained for at least 30 days, which means that within 30 days, you are able to obtain POI details by Place ID from Place Details API. After 30 days, the interpolated POIs(both Place ID and details) may expire and inaccessible from the Places Details API.</p></li>   </ul></li> </ul><br>

If no language is specified, or not supported for a particular result, the partner automatically chooses a language for the result.</p> <p>For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for a location around Athens, Greece, with the <code>language</code> parameter set to <code>en</code>. The <code>city</code> in the results will most likely be returned as <code>Athens</code>.</p> <p>If you set the <code>language</code> parameter to <code>el</code>, for Greek, then the <code>city</code> in the results will more likely be returned as <code>Αθήνα</code>.</p> <p>If the data provider does not have a value for Greek, the result will be in a language that the provider does support.</p><br>
